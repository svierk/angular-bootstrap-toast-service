# üçû Angular 13 Toast Service with Bootstrap 5

The idea of the project was to create a service that allows displaying different types of toast notifications to the user, e.g. success or error toasts.

The application consists of essentially three components: A toast component that represents a single toast notification, a toaster component that maintains and stacks all current toasts, and the toast service.

## Getting started
